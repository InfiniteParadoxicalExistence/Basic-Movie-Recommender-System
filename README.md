# Basic-Movie-Recommender-System

A content-based movie recommender system built with Python and a dummy model was made, which can be deployed using Streamlit. The system leverages the TMDB dataset and applies text vectorization (Bag of Words) to recommend similar movies based on genres, keywords, and other features.
